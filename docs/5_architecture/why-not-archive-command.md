# Why Not `archive_command`?

There’s a significant difference between using `archive_command` and archiving WAL files via the streaming replication
protocol.

The `archive_command` is triggered only after a WAL file is fully completed-typically when it reaches 16 MiB (the
default segment size). This means that in a crash scenario, you could lose up to 16 MiB of data.

You can mitigate this by setting a lower `archive_timeout` (e.g., 1 minute), but even then, in a worst-case scenario,
you risk losing up to 1 minute of data.
Also, it’s important to note that PostgreSQL preallocates WAL files to the configured `wal_segment_size`, so they are
created with full size regardless of how much data has been written. (Quote from documentation:
_It is therefore unwise to set a very short `archive_timeout` - it will bloat your archive storage._).

In contrast, streaming WAL archiving-when used with replication slots and the `synchronous_standby_names`
parameter-ensures that the system can be restored to the latest committed transaction.
This approach provides true zero data loss (**RPO=0**), making it ideal for high-durability requirements.
