# Configuration File

Configuration file structure

The configuration file is in JSON or YML format (\*.json is preferred in CI).
It supports environment variable placeholders like `${PGRWL_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}`.

You may either use `pgrwl daemon -c config.yml -m receive` or provide the corresponding environment variables and run
`pgrwl daemon`.
